# Motivation

- We can model continuous, logical, and count response variables
- We can include quantitative and categorical predictors
- What about nonlinear relationships?

---
class: small

# Already nonlinear
## Categorical predictor variables

  - Making use of indicator variables for (all but one of the) categories, we can model a situation where each value of the predictor variable has a different effect on the response. 
  - But...if forcing a quantitative variable to be categorical...
    - How many categories?
    - What about periodicity?
    
---
# Already nonlinear
## GLMs
  - In binary or count regression, predictor-response relationship is linear on the scale of the link function ( = scale of the RHS of the equation)
  - But non-linear on the scale of the response variable (LHS)
  - Well - Nonlinear, but always **monotonic**


---
class: small

# Not going there
## Popular options that we won't pursue (and why)

- Transformations of predictors or response (log, powers, etc.)
- Polynomials (adding $\text{predictor}^2$, $\text{predictor}^3$, etc.)
- Good *with theoretical justification*, otherwise hard to choose
- We want one flexible solution to get any shape
- We want easily interpretable results

---
## Non-linear, non-monotonic 
## Example: Bat migration & Weather

```{r, include = FALSE}
bats <- read.csv('https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/9348010')
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
    # old url: 'http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/highwire/filestream/33982/field_highwire_adjunct_files/2/rsbl20170395supp3.csv')
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
gf_boxplot(relativehumid ~ factor(migration), data = bats)

bats <- bats |>
  mutate(humid_bins = cut(bats$relativehumid, breaks=7))

bats2 <- bats |>
   group_by(humid_bins) |>
  summarize(migration_prop = prop(~migration == 1),
            median_hum = median(relativehumid)) |>
  ungroup()

gf_point(migration_prop ~ median_hum, data = bats2) |> 
  gf_labs(x='Relative Humidity', y='Proportion\nMigrating') |>
  gf_smooth(method = 'gam', formula = y ~ s(x, k = 4, bs = "cs"), color = 'grey84')

## Our case study: [GRR weather station](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search) + [metadata](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/cdo/documentation/GHCND_documentation.pdf)

```{r}
grweather <- read_csv('https://sldr.netlify.app/data/grr-weather-metric.csv',
         show_col_types = FALSE) |>
    select(SNOW, TMIN, DATE, TSUN) |>

         WEEK = lubridate::isoweek(DATE),
         PREV.SNOW = lag(SNOW)) |> na.omit()

# Smooth functions

- Goal: predictor-response relationship can have any shape
- linear, or nonlinear with *any* shape
- user control of "wiggliness"

---
class: small

# Basis functions

- Several parts, or *basis functions*, sum to form a smooth
- Each has simple shape
- Scaled and added together, yield nearly any shape
- Higher basis dimension (more functions added together) can = more wiggles 
- Goal: enough flexibility to fit data well, without *overfitting* 

---

# Overfitting

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '95%'}

# Fitting GAMs
## Generalized Additive Models

- R Package `mgcv`, function `gam()`
- Can fit any family (linear, binary, count) depending on response variable type
- Smooth Types: [App](https://connect.cs.calvin.edu/DATA545/smooth/) 
- More background ([workshop materials](https://eric-pedersen.github.io/mgcv-esa-workshop/))

<!-- # Model Planning -->
<!-- ## Which terms should be smooths?  -->

<!-- - Explore the data? -->
<!-- - Think it through? -->
<!-- - *All* of them? -->

<!-- - Pros: -->
<!-- - Cons: -->

# Model formula syntax
## Function `s()` specifies a smooth. Inputs:

- variable name(s)
- `k` (see `?choose.k`)
- `bs`
- `by`

How do we choose? see [App](https://connect.cs.calvin.edu/DATA545/smooth/) ; Defaults: `tp` or `cs` as default options, or `cc` for cyclic
---
# Break my App

- What choices of smooth type and/or `k` work *well* for your variable?
- What choices of smooth type and `k` can result in a smooth that seems overfitted, or mismatched to data in some other way?
- What does shrinkage (`bs = _s`) do?

[https://connect.cs.calvin.edu/DATA545/smooth/](https://connect.cs.calvin.edu/DATA545/smooth/)

---

# `gam()` Options
We can also fit the model and smooths by different methods and with options:

- ~~`method = 'GCV.Cp'`~~
- ~~`method = 'REML'`~~
- `method = 'ML'`
- `select = TRUE` (or ~~`FALSE`~~)

---

# GAM Example - Snow

```{r, fig.show='hold', fig.width=2.2, fig.height=2.25, results='markup'}
library(mgcv)
snow.gam <- gam(SNOW ~ s(DAY, k = 20, bs = 'cc') +
                s(TMIN, k = 5, bs = 'cs') +
                s(YEAR, k = 5, bs = 'cs') + PREV.SNOW,
              data = grweather,
              method = 'ML', 
              select = TRUE)
```

# Choosing K?
## Silk (big k) vs. Carpet (small k, min. ~3)

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '70%'}
gf_segment(0 + SNOW ~ DAY + DAY,
           alpha = 0.2, data = grweather) |>
  gf_labs(y = 'Snow (mm)', x = 'Day of Year')
```

---
# Other Responses, REs

- Families: gaussian, binomial, poisson, **negbin**
- Add simple (not nested) random effects to formula: `s(variable, bs = 're')`
- More REs in a GAM: `gamm4::gamm4()` (beyond our class/demo next week)


---

# Model Assessment

- Conditions (for family used) must be met: ~~L~~INE *or* ~~L~~I, mean-variance
- All must be checked as for `(g)lm(mTMB)()` - except linearity!

---
class: small
## Additional Checks for GAM

```{r, fig.show='hide', fig.width=5.5, fig.height=3.5, results='markup'}
par(mar=c(4,4,2,2))
gam.check(snow.gam)
```

---

## Prediction Plots (as usual)

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 2, out.width = '80%'}
spred <- ggpredict(snow.gam,
                   terms = c('DAY', 'YEAR[2022]')) 
plot(spred) |> 
  gf_labs(title = '', 
          y = 'Expected Snow (mm)', x = 'Day of Year')
```

---
class: small
##  Which fixed values were used?

```{r}
spred
```

---

# Shrinkage 

- Some model selection is (or can be) done during model fitting
- What smooth is best? Or is the relationship a line? A flat line?  
- Using *shrinkage* basis or including `select = TRUE` allows for this
- Our Default?

---

# P-value selection

- Caution: **p-values are approximate!** 
- Best when using ML (1st choice), REML (2nd choice).

```{r, results = 'hide'}
anova(snow.gam)
```

Note: use `anova()` (not `Anova()`) for GAMs - **unlike** `lm()`, `glm()`, `glmmTMB()`. Can also use `AIC()` or `BIC()` too.
