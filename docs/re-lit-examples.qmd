# Instructions

Each group should choose one paper to study and present. For many
groups, there should be one with similarities to your project. Each
group should try to choose a different paper.

# Paper Options

-   [Parenting intervention in Sure Start services for children at risk
    of developing conduct disorder: pragmatic randomised controlled
    trial](https://www.bmj.com/content/334/7595/678.short)

-   [Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Facilities and Hygiene Practices
    Associated with Diarrhea and Vomiting in Monastic Schools,
    Myanmar](https://www.ajtmh.org/content/journals/10.4269/ajtmh.15-0290)

-   [Reduction in diarrhoea rates after household water filter
    distribution in small and remote communities in
    Liberia](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/27707571.2023.2205716)

-   [Identification of distinct movement patterns in Pacific leatherback
    turtle populations influenced by ocean
    conditions](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/11-0633)

    -   *Note: Focus on "Analysis of foraging and migration behavior"
        and "Effects of ocean conditions". The "State space model" is
        well beyond the scope of our course; it was used first to
        classify tracks. At each time point along a track, the
        state-space model estimates whether or not the turtle is in
        feeding mode (also referred to in the paper as Area Restricted
        Search (ARS) or "mode 2").*

-   [The relationship between body mass and field metabolic rate among
    individual birds and
    mammals](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2656.12086)

-   [A randomised controlled trial to test the effect of promoting
    caregiver contingent talk on language development in infants from
    diverse socioeconomic status
    backgrounds](https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jcpp.12725)

-   [Non-randomized intervention study of naloxone co-prescription for
    primary care patients on long-term opioid therapy for
    pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5783639/pdf/nihms916740.pdf)

    -   *Note: Focus on "Feasibility Analyses" (which is a random
        effects model). If you have time to consider the "Analysis of ED
        Use" and/or "Analysis of Opioid Dose" as well, know that GEEs
        are an alternative mathematical formulation that, like random
        effects models, can also make regression work in the presence of
        non-independent residuals. So if you have time/interest, you can
        try to figure out: what would a random effects version of these
        GEE models look like?*

    fiber membrane filter intervention in
