## YAML Header
If you grab the example quarto presentation file from an online source, it seems the YAML header isn't preserved. Copy/paste from the next slide to the very start of your qmd file!

## Slides in Quarto

-   Delete this slide once your presentation is done.
-   Leave blank line before and after a bulleted list.
-   Each new slide starts with a level-2 header: **2 hashtags, space,
    your title**
-   To learn more about Quarto presentations see
    <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>. Much more customization is
    possible, but we're trying to keep it simpler!
-   If you want the Calvin colors/theme/logo, download the file
    <https://stacyderuiter.github.io/stat245-sp24/calvin-slides.scss>
    and save it to the same directory as your quarto file

## Instructions: RE Lit Presentation

-   Delete this slide once you understand your task.
-   Fill in this template with answers gleaned from your reading of your
    paper.
-   You are **not reading and interpreting the whole paper**. You are
    taking a first look at it and mining it for specific information.
-   I recommend reading the abstract, then focusing on the methods
    section, reviewing all figures, and also checking the results
    section as needed. This is an high-level overview, not a deep read.

## The Big Question

-   Replace the title of this slide with a brief statement of the
    *topic* of your paper
-   List as a bullet point (or more than one, if your paper has multiple
    RE models) the *scientific question* that your paper tries to answer
    with a RE model. Try to write the question as simply as possible -
    in words a 6th-grader could understand!

>> If you would like to include a direct quote from the paper, you can do it like this -- start with two greater-than signs, and then add the text you want to quote. It will be formatted like a block quote (check out the rendered version to see the effect).

## Best Figure - Interp!

-   Choose the best figure in the paper (easiest to understand,
    communicating the most information, ideally relevant to your
    question of interest).
-   In a bullet, say what you learn from the figure (what trends or
    patterns are illustrated?)
-   In a bullet, explain what design features you love about this figure
    that made it best
-   Maybe move this slide *after* the actual figure.

## Best Figure - Figure!

*Note, if you don't have a URL to the image file, you can screenshot it
and upload it to the same directory as your Quarto file.*

## Random Effects Model Description

Fill in as many list items as you possibly can:

-   Response variable - description and type (continuous, binary,
    count...)
-   Model type (family and link function)
-   Fixed effects predictors
-   Interactions (if any)
-   Random effects
-   Random slopes (if any)

## Modeling Process Checklist

Which of the following items are **described and presented in the
paper**? (~~Cross out~~ things you can't find)

-   Model planning, causal diagram
-   Plots of the data
-   Coefficients, model summary information
-   Model assessment
-   Model selection
-   Model interpretation - what results mean
-   Prediction plots

## Answer to the Question

What, according to the paper, is the answer to the question (that you
identified on an earlier slide, and that the authors used an RE model to
answer)?

## Your Questions

-   List here any thing you are confused or curious about.
-   What was hard to figure out?
-   Is there anything you wish authors had added to the paper (details,
    figures...)?
-   What questions do you have about the authors' approach?

## Submit!

-   Don't forget to **Submit your rendered slides on Moodle at the end of
    class.**
-   *Submit whatever you have finished during class time - you are not
    required to finish on your own time.*
-   You may present work in class Tuesday - plan for this as a group!
-   Delete this slide once you understand.
