## Confounders

What if we *exclude* a confounder from our model?

What if we *include* a confounder in our model?

## Colliders

What if we *exclude* a collider in our model?

What if we *include* a collider in our model?

## Mediation

When there's a mediation chain, do we want to measure the *total*
effect? Or differentiate pathways?
