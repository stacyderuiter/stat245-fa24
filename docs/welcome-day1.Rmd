# Data are People?

- Consider the "commandment" that *Data are People* alongside the [Heidelberg Catechism Q & A #6](https://www.crcna.org/welcome/beliefs/confessions/heidelberg-catechism). Thoughts?
- Speaking from a Reformed Christian perspective, what if anything would be different about this "commandment"? Explain why, citing sources if any.

## I Corinthians 8:1-3

>> Now regarding your question about food that has been offered to idols. Yes, we know that "we all have knowledge" about this issue. But while knowledge makes us feel important, it is love that strengthens the church. Anyone who claims to know all the answers doesnâ€™t really know very much. But the person who loves God is the one whom God recognizes.

# One idea: Stacked Bars

```{r}

---
# Not Yet...

- You likely *can't* replicate the example R code yet (and today won't teach you  how)
- Goal: Start forming habits of thinking...
  - Get used to structure of a graphics command
  - Imagine a desired result *before* typing code
  - Think creatively about problems, causes, solutions

# Take Home Ideas

- *Think* and *Imagine* before you graph
- Choose a chart type that fits your data
 - Categorical: bars, pies, Cleveland dot/lollipop
 - Quantitative: histogram, density, boxplot
 - Relationships: scatter plot, boxplots, facets...
- Use color, axis limits, labels, design *to tell the story*

---

# Go Forth...

- Today got you thinking...
- Tutorials will fill in the details...
- *And* give you R code tools to implement
- Next time: Constructive conversation + critique
- Next week: practice creating and critiquing

---
# Wait a sec...

## If graphs tell the whole story, why learn models??
